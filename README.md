# Yoga Pose Detection Through EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50

The project focuses on drawing clear comparison between EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50 by training the models for Human Pose Estimation Task. The models are trained on 3 datasets which are built from scratch. The datasets defer with respect to number of classes (107 and 54) as well as image preprocessing steps such as data augmentation, contour generation and mediapipe joints plotting.
